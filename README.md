# Docker

This website is developed locally using Docker, so there is no need to have any version of Ruby or Bundle installed on your system.

To build and serve the website from Docker running in WSL, run this command in the Linux terminal in the root directory of this repo:

./local_serve.sh build

./local_serve.sh serve
